### Essential Linux Commands for Developers

Mastering basic Linux commands is crucial for developers to efficiently manage files and systems. Here's a concise guide with practical examples, covering essential options for each command:

1. **List Directory Contents (`ls`)**
    - Example: `ls -l`
    - Description: Lists files and directories in the current directory with detailed information.
    - Options: `a` lists all files, including hidden files; `l` displays detailed information; `h` makes file sizes human-readable.
2. **Change Directory (`cd`)**
    - Example: `cd ~/Documents`
    - Description: Changes the current directory to `Documents`.
    - Options: `cd ..` moves up one directory; `cd -` switches to the previous directory.
3. **Print Working Directory (`pwd`)**
    - Example: `pwd`
    - Description: Displays the full path of the current directory.
4. **Make Directory (`mkdir`)**
    - Example: `mkdir NewFolder`
    - Description: Creates a new directory named `NewFolder`.
    - Option: `p` creates parent directories as needed.
5. **Remove Directory (`rmdir`)**
    - Example: `rmdir NewFolder`
    - Description: Removes an empty directory named `NewFolder`.
6. **Create a File (`touch`)**
    - Example: `touch newfile.txt`
    - Description: Creates a new empty file named `newfile.txt`.
    - Options: `a` updates the access time; `m` updates the modification time.
7. **Remove File or Directory (`rm`)**
    - Example: `rm -r NewFolder`
    - Description: Deletes the file `newfile.txt` or directory `NewFolder` and its contents.
    - Options: `r` recursively removes directories and their contents; `f` forces removal without prompting.
8. **Copy File or Directory (`cp`)**
    - Example: `cp -r olddir newdir`
    - Description: Copies `olddir` and its contents to `newdir`.
    - Options: `r` recursively copies directories; `i` prompts before overwriting.
9. **Move or Rename File (`mv`)**
    - Example: `mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt`
    - Description: Moves or renames `oldfile.txt` to `newfile.txt`.
    - Option: `i` prompts before overwriting.
10. **Display File Contents (`cat`)**
    - Example: `cat newfile.txt`
    - Description: Displays the contents of `newfile.txt`.
    - Option: `n` numbers all output lines.
11. **Page Through File (`more` & `less`)**
    - Example: `less newfile.txt`
    - Description: Displays file contents one page at a time (`less` allows backward navigation).
    - Option for `less`: `N` displays line numbers.
12. **Search in File (`grep`)**
    - Example: `grep "pattern" file.txt`
    - Description: Searches for a specified pattern in `file.txt`.
    - Options: `i` ignores case; `r` searches directories recursively; `n` displays line numbers with output.
13. **Change Permissions (`chmod`)**
    - Example: `chmod 755 script.sh`
    - Description: Changes the permissions of `script.sh` to `755` (rwxr-xr-x).
    - Option: `R` recursively changes permissions for directories and their contents.
14. **Change Owner (`chown`)**
    - Example: `chown user:group file.txt`
    - Description: Changes the owner and group of `file.txt` to `user` and `group`.
    - Option: `R` recursively changes ownership for directories and their contents.
15. **List Processes (`ps`)**
    - Example: `ps aux`
    - Description: Lists all running processes with detailed information.
    - Options: `e` selects all processes; `f` displays full-format listing.
16. **Display System Processes (`top`)**
    - Example: `top`
    - Description: Displays a real-time list of system processes, resource usage, and allows interaction.
17. **Network Configuration (`ifconfig`)**
    - Example: `ifconfig`
    - Description: Displays network interface configuration.
    - Options: `ifconfig eth0 down` disables the `eth0` interface; `ifconfig eth0 up` enables the `eth0` interface.
18. **Test Connectivity (`ping`)**
    - Example: `ping google.com`
    - Description: Tests network connectivity to `google.com`.
    - Option: `c 4` sends only 4 packets.
19. **Secure Shell (`ssh`)**
    - Example: `ssh user@remote_host`
    - Description: Connects to a remote host over SSH.
    - Options: `i` specifies an identity file for public key authentication; `p` specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
